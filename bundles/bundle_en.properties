##Turrets
block.frestorm-volcano.name = Volcano
block.frestorm-volcano.description = The Vulcan rapid-fire turret, which requires a 5.56 caliber bullet, is extremely effective if 5.56 caliber silicon cartridges are used. It was assembled according to the drawing of such weapons as "M61 Volcano" (the creator of the first Gatling and "M61 Volcano" Richard Jordan Gatling) and was modified. As a result, the 20 mm bullets were replaced with 5.56 caliber bullets, as a result of which it was necessary to add the power of the shot, because there was no damage and the damage was minimal.
block.frestorm-shock-shot.name = Shock shot
block.frestorm-shock-shot.description = The gun with a very poor recharge and the power of the shot radius was redesigned from a sniper rifle, also the shells were made safer and due to accidental explosions during firing, thereby the fragments due to the explosion were stopped.
